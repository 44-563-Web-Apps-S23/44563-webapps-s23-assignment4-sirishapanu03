        <h2>THE EXCHANGE</h2>
        <h5>BY ALTHEA THURSTON</h5>
                    
        <p> _The curtain rises upon an office scene. Seemingly there is nothing
                 unusual about this office: it has tables, chairs, a filing cabinet,
                 and a hat-rack. A portion of the office is railed off at the right.
                 Within this enclosed space is a commodious desk and swivel-chair;
                 and the filing cabinet stands against the wall. This railed-off
                 portion of the office belongs, exclusively, to the_ JUDGE. _Here he
                 is wont to spend many hours--sometimes to read or write, and again,
                 perhaps, he will just sit and ponder upon the vagaries of mankind.
                 The_ JUDGE _is a tall, spare man with rather long gray hair, which
                 shows beneath the skull-cap that he always wears. When we first see
                 him, he is reading a letter, and evidently he is not pleased, for
                 he is tapping with impatient fingers upon his desk._</p>
            
        <p> _At the left of the stage is a heavily curtained door which leads
                 to an inner room. At centre rear is another door which evidently
                 leads to the street, as it is through this door that the_ POOR MAN,
                 _the_ VAIN WOMAN, _and the_ RICH CITIZEN _will presently enter,
                 each upon his special quest. The hat-rack stands near the street
                 door, and we glimpse a soft black hat and a long black overcoat
                 hanging upon it._</p>
            
        <p> _Down stage to the left is a flat-topped desk, littered with papers
                 and letters. This desk has two large drawers, wherein a number of
                 miscellaneous articles might be kept. It is at this desk that we
                 catch our first glimpse of_ IMP. _He is busily writing in a huge
                 ledger, and he seems to be enjoying his work, for he chuckles the
                 while._ IMP _is a little rogue; he looks it and acts it, and we
                 feel that he has a Mephistophelian spirit. He wears a dark-green
                 tight-fitting uniform, trimmed with red braid. His saucy little
                 round cap is always cocked over one eye. He is ever chuckling
                 impishly, and we feel that he is slyly gleeful over the weaknesses
                 of mankind and the difficulties that beset them._</p>

        <h4>COVERSATION</h4>                 
            
        <p>IMP.</p>
           <p> [_Throws down his pen, chuckles, and half standing on the rungs of
            his chair and balancing himself against his desk, surveys the ledger._]
            Your honor, I've all the miseries listed to date and a fine lot there is
            to choose from. Everything from bunions to old wives for exchange.</p>

        <p>JUDGE.</p>
           <p>[_Scowls and impatiently taps the letter he is reading._] Here is
            another one. A woman suspects her husband of a misalliance. Wants to
            catch him, but is so crippled with rheumatism she can't get about. Wants
            us to exchange her rheumatism for something that won't interfere with
            either her walking or her eyesight.</p> 

        <p>IMP.</p> [_Referring to the ledger and running his finger along the lines._]
        We have a defective heart or a lazy liver that we could give her.

        <p>JUDGE.</p>
        <p>[_Irritably tossing the letter over to_ IMP.] She would not be
            satisfied. People never are. They always want to change their miseries,
            but never their vices. Each thinks his own cross heavier than others
            have to bear, but he is very willing to make light of his own weaknesses
            and shortcomings. He thinks they are not half so bad as his neighbor's.
            I have tried for years to aid distressed humanity, but I can't satisfy
            them. I am growing tired of it all, Imp. People need a lesson and
            they're going to get it, too. I am going to----</p>
            
        <p> [_Knock is heard at the street door._ JUDGE _sighs, turns to his
        desk and begins to write_. IMP _sweeps the litter of papers on his
        desk into a drawer, closes ledger, and goes to answer knock_.</p>
            
        <p>IMP.</p>
        <p>Here comes another misery.</p>
            
        <p>  [IMP _opens the door to admit the_ POOR MAN, _who is very shabbily
        dressed. He hesitates, looks around the room as if he were in the
        wrong place, and then addresses_ IMP _in a loud whisper_.</p>

        <p>POOR MAN.</p>
        <p> [_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.] Is that
            him? </p>

        <p>IMP.</p>
        <p>[_Whispering loudly his reply._] Yes, that is his honor. </p>

        <p>POOR MAN.</p>
        <p>[_Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness._] Do I
            dare speak to him? </p>
